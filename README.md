Xeno Invasion HTML5 version
===========================

This game is a port to HTML5 of our 7h compo on IGK 2013 (Sieldce, Poland) http://www.genbit.info/igk/.

There are some major differences between the HTML5 port and the oryginal SDL game:

- No achivements
- Lava! Because everyone loves lava! Now when the player destroys all the ground and a bullet gets into 
   lava - lava will rise and reset the ground. (This will also happen when to many creepers will fall 
   into lava).
- The game will automaticaly pause when there is no focus on the window / tab.
- Added a 'mute' button.



Tested on browsers
------------------

- Google Chrome 26.0.1410.63
- Firefox 12.0 (as for now, there is a audio-canvas lag issue that needs to be resolved)
- Opera 12.15
